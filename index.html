            The goal of this personal site is to have an owned platform for my digital avatar in cyberspace. Parts may be static (and those parts may be manually or programmatically generated). Other parts may be dynamic. I hope to gradually, playfully, and intentionally build, destroy, and reimagine this little sandbox, where every grain is a whiff of my own curious impulse.

                Here is my first blog entry. Hello, World! I remember writing my first "Hello, World!" in code 20 years ago at a Gateway laptop running Windows 2000 on a folding table in a rented house in Ciudad Bugambilias in Guadalajara.
