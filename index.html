            The goal of this personal site is to have an owned platform for my digital avatar in cyberspace. Parts may be static (and those parts may be manually or programmatically generated). Other parts may be dynamic. I hope to gradually, playfully, and intentionally build, destroy, and reimagine this little sandbox, where every grain is a whiff of my own curious impulse.

                    What is a <b>|</b>? The <b>|</b> character, also known as the vertical bar, was used to denote a period or full stop <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/virgule">across Europe</a> and India. The pipe as we know it today in programming was originally represented with a <em>broken</em> vertical bar <b>¦</b> to avoid confusion with <b>I</b> and <b>l</b> in early fonts without serifs. <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/28245.html">ISO/IEC 8859-1</a> introduced separate <b>|</b> and <b>¦</b> character, with the former recognized as the canonical vertical bar and pipe.

                    The word pipe itself is almost unchanged from the vulgar Latin <i>pipa</i>. <i>Pipa</i> referred to a tube-shaped instrument that could <i>pipare</i>, or chirp and peep. This word for a chirping, peeping instrument an also became a word for an instrument of conveyance because of the overlap in the form of the function. A tubular reed made for a good musical pipe; a ceramic tube made for a good fluid pipe.

                    In Unix-based systems, piping is a way of passing messages between programs. One process' output, or standard output stream <b>stdout</b>, is <i>piped</i> directly into another process' input, or standard input stream <b>stdin</b>. What is so standard about this streams? They adhere to a common format, such as text or binary data. The operating system provides an in-memory buffer to receive the output program's stream until its process is complete or the buffer is full, at which point the input program is prompted to read from the buffer. The Unix shell syntax for this looks like <code>program1 | program2</code>. A real, practical example looks like <code>ls -c | head</code>. This pipeline lists the ten most recently modified files in the present working directory.

                    We can thank <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html">Douglas McIlroy</a> for developing the concept and pushing for its inclusion into the original UNIX operating system.

                    Here is my first blog entry. Hello, World! I remember writing my first "Hello, World!" in code 20 years ago at a Gateway laptop running Windows 2000 on a folding table in a rented house in Ciudad Bugambilias in Guadalajara.
